### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an operations lead for VIP casino gaming and operations by day, and a Back-End Software Developer and Cyber Security student by night.
I have a unique set of skills and experiences that I bring to the table. By managing high stakes gaming operations, I've learned how to keep a cool head under pressure and think on my feet. On the other hand, my passion for coding and cyber security allows me to have a strong analytical and problem-solving mindset.
When I'm not busy counting chips or writing code, you can find me studying the latest cyber threats and trying to come up with new ways to protect the virtual world from harm.

I like to think of myself as a jack of all trades, master of none. But in all seriousness, I bring a unique perspective to the table and I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.

So, if you're looking for someone who can code while keeping a poker face, you've come to the right place. Let's work together to make the virtual world a safer place, one line of code at a time.

PS: I'm also available for high stakes baccarat games and cyber security consulting, just saying.
